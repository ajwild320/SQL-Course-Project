# SQL-Course-Project
This is a repository for my course project from ITCS 3160 - Introduction To Databases

I worked as part of a team of 4. We worked together to complete all project sprints 
and Database design aspects. We created this database from scratch and updated it 
multiple times until we reached our final product.
